This project is not maintained and I have not tested or needed it in a long while. As far as I am aware, Unity seems to have started including a built-in way for setting the sorting order of sprites (at least for tilemaps, need to check further) and as such I'd recommend you to not use this.

# Unity-Axis-Sort-Order
Allows sorting based on any axis position, editing the position offset and seeing changes in real-time in the Scene View.
